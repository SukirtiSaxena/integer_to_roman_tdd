Integer to Roman convertor TDD style
## Problem description - 
https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/

The Romans wrote numbers using letters : I, V, X, L, C, D, M. 

Roman numerals are the symbols used in a system of numerical notation based on the ancient Roman system. 
The symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, standing respectively for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000.


The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII
etc.
There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didnâ€™t tend to go any higher)
